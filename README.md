# Adaptive dropout

This is an example of dropout which varies according to the difference between vlidation and training accuracy.
Note that this is not the same as [Standout](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5032-adaptive-dropout-for-training-deep-neural-networks.pdf), which is also known as adaptive dropout.

I do not claim to have invented this, I'm sure someone else has done this already.
This is just a mini programming exercise for myself to practice PyTorch.
